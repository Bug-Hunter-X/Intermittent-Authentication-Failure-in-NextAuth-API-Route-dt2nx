# Intermittent Authentication Failure in NextAuth API Route

This repository demonstrates a bug where NextAuth's session check in an API route intermittently fails, returning `null` even when a user is logged in. This leads to unpredictable authentication failures.

## Bug Description

The API route uses `unstable_getServerSession` to check for a user session.  However, in some cases, the session check returns `null`, resulting in an 'Unauthorized' error even though the user is authenticated.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Attempt to access the API route.  You may need to log in through NextAuth first.
5. Observe that the API route sometimes returns an 'Unauthorized' error, even when logged in.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the API route is correctly configured to handle the asynchronous nature of `unstable_getServerSession`.  This can involve proper error handling and retry mechanisms. Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for the corrected code.
